About Me: 
Like many kids these days, I grew a fondness for gaming. In my early twenties I began hosting and modifying multiplayer game servers. While modding game servers I learned to enjoy programming and soon deduced that my life would not be complete until I could claim a position as a senior programmer. Like an adrenalin junky, there is no comparison to the thrill of creating a working piece of code. I can’t wait to be a part of the creation the next big “thing” and nothing can stop me from achieving greatness.
