                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>My name is Franz Fernando.  I'm currently a student in the Computer Science program at Lambda School.  My background is primarily in electronics, particularly in digital and analog circuits.  I have experience with multiple stages of the manufacturing process whether during the early prototype stages or during production. This process includes tasks such as drafting schematic diagrams and service manuals, circuit board design, troubleshooting and repair, and quality control.  Eventually, I began to dabble with the software side of things and that is what sparked my inteterest in programming.  Lambda School is providing me with a great opportunity to bridge the knowledge I have on the hardware side of things with the software side of it all.
