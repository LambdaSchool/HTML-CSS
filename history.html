				<div class="Box__description">I am an aspiring Full-Stack Developer currently enrolled in Lambda School. </br>
          I've been working ever since I graduated High School. Growing up, my foster Father would build computers all the time. </br>
          Back then it was mostly for playing video games but I've been interested in the tech industry ever since. </br>
          Before I graduated High School in 2014; I became proficient in assembling PCs, </br>
          I learned basic HTML and CSS, How to Troubleshoot basic hardware and software complications. </br>
          After I graduated I began to work at Starbucks. It was here that I really learned what it was like to </br>
          work in a team environment. That lesson stayed with me when I was a server and really helped me grow as a person. </br>
          I feel like I was successful in my workplace because of that. Besides that, Customer Service just came naturally to me. </br>
          I guess you could say it was complimentary. After Volunteering at the Theosophical Society in America </br>
          for a few months I was offered a part-time IT job. The Theosophical Society had a small IT staff and </br>
          needed more help tackling the day to day helpdesk issues. Tasks such as resolving PEBKAC issues, </br>
          equipment maintenance, cutting a new head on an ethernet cable, password recovery, printer installation and the list goes on. </br>
          Some of the more interesting things I did through the year were Server Administration, a lot more computer and </br>
          server building, expanding our Network and learning how to manage networks or Web Design with extensive work </br>
          in WHM and Cpanel. That list goes on too. </br>
          </br>
          If you've read this far then I want to thank you for taking the time to read it. </br>
          I am still young but I am eager to keep moving forward and to keep learning. </br>
          Thank you and have a great day!
