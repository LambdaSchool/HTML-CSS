                Welcome to my portfolio. Scroll through this page to find a small autobiography. Halfway through there will be some images,
                descriptions, and links to some of my projects and repositories, and towards the bottom you can find my contact
                information. Thank you for stopping by. Feel free to browse around and be sure to let me know if there is
                something you would like me to add.

            <p>My name is Moises C. Dobarganes, most people call me “Moe” and I am a software developer. I graduated from Full
                Sail University in 2004 and am currently enrolled in Lambda School’s computer science course. I have worked
                as Graphic Designer, Computer Animator, Game Designer, IT Solutions Consultant, Operations Manager, and Software
                Developer. Over the years I have developed a passion for programming and solving problems through leveraging
                computing power. I enjoy doing data analysis and visualization, as well as coding user interfaces and predicting
                user patterns. My favorite part of developing software lies in pre-production and planning, I enjoy whiteboarding
                an Idea, designing the different aspects of the program, and how those modules interact with each other.
