        <img src="./img/PortfolioPic2.jpg" />
        <p>My name is Moises C. Dobarganes, most people call me “Moe” and I am a software developer. I graduated from Full Sail
            University in 2004 and am currently enrolled in Lambda School’s computer science course. I have worked as Graphic
            Designer, Computer Animator, Game Designer, IT Solutions Consultant, Operations Manager, and Software Developer.
            Over the years I have developed a passion for programming and solving problems through leveraging computing power.
            I enjoy doing data analysis and visualization, as well as coding user interfaces and predicting user patterns.
            My favorite part of developing software lies in pre-production and planning, I like whiteboarding an Idea, designing
            the different aspects of the program, and how those modules interact with each other.

                <p>
                    Until recently many have tried connecting with the Computer Gamer audience, and all attempts have failed to truly hit home. The Gamer audience grows every day and companies keep employing the same methods, yet expecting different results. Something has to change in order to garnish the full attention of such large audience.

                        This web based calculator was made using HTML / CSS / JavaScript DOM manipulation techniques. It was made purely for demonstration purposes, but it has grown into a full project on its own.

                <h3>Common JS Functions Broken Down (JS)</h3>
                <p>
                    This project tackles breaking down commonly used JavaScript functions that are built in either within arrays as prototypes or any other data types. The project began as an attempt to better understand the innerworkings of common JavaScript functionality, and it keeps growing. This helps developers who are beginning to code get a better understanding of what is going under the hood on some of those prototype functions.
